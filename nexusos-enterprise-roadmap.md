## 🎯 STRATEGIC CONTEXT

### Competitive Landscape (March 16, 2026)
- **NemoClaw** (Nvidia) announced TODAY at GTC - your biggest competitor
- **Window:** 3-6 months before they mature
- **Differentiation:** "Complete platform" vs "framework"

### The One-Line Strategy
> "Stop being everything. Be the thing Nvidia can't be: a complete, opinionated, deploy-in-minutes AI agent OS for enterprises who don't have a platform team — with a cognitive layer no one else has."

### Key Strategic Shifts
1. **Revenue:** Tiered pricing (not just 5.5% fee)
2. **Compliance:** DPA, SOC 2, AI liability before selling
3. **Security:** Fix CRITICALs BEFORE any enterprise sales
4. **Community:** Open-source core to build ecosystem

---

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

1. **This Week:** Disable root SSH, fix JWT, add password complexity
2. **This Month:** Add streaming, GPU support, WebSocket
3. **Next 30 Days:** Get professional pentest
4. **Next 60 Days:** DPA, GDPR docs, SOC 2 prep
5. **Next 90 Days:** Launch tiered pricing, community

*Roadmap updated based on:*
- *Third-party security audit (March 16, 2026)*
- *Competitive intelligence vs NemoClaw, OpenClaw, CrewAI*
- *Strategic positioning as "Apple of AI"*
