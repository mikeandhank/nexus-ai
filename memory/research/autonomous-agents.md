# Autonomous Agent Research

_What makes successful autonomous agents successful_

---

## Successful Agents Analyzed

### 1. Devin AI (Cognition Labs)
**What it is:** First AI "software engineer" (mid-2025)
**Key Success Factors:**
- End-to-end task completion for coding
- Built on transformer-based LLMs + reinforcement learning
- Planning-execution-verification loops

### 2. Manus (Chinese AI Agent)
**What it is:** General-purpose autonomous agent
**Key Success Factors:**
- State-of-the-art on GAIA benchmark
- "Context engineering" - each action builds persistent context
- Fleet of 80 million virtual computers for reliability
- Multi-modal (text, images, code)

### 3. AutoGPT
**What it is:** Pioneered autonomous self-directed task completion
**Key Success Factors:**
- Breaks complex objectives into subtasks
- Executes and adapts based on results
- Valuable for research and complex problem-solving

## Core Architectural Patterns That Work

### Multi-Agent Architecture
- **Planner** - Breaks down tasks
- **Execution** - Does the work
- **Verification** - Checks results
- Specialized sub-agents work in parallel

### Planning-Execution-Verification Loop
1. Plan what to do
2. Execute
3. Verify result
4. Loop until done

### Persistent Context
- Each action builds on previous context
- "Context engineering" - iterative refinement
- State maintained across long-running tasks

### Advanced Tool Integration
- Browsers, code editors, databases
- Virtual sandboxes for safe execution
- Asynchronous processing

### Adaptive Learning
- Learns from interactions
- Personalizes outputs over time
- Continuous feedback loops

## What I Can Learn From This

| Pattern | How I Can Apply |
|---------|-----------------|
| Multi-agent | I already use subagents - can make them more specialized |
| Verification | Add verification step before completing tasks |
| Persistent context | NexusOS does this - need to use it better |
| Tool integration | Expand my tool usage (browser already working) |
| Learning | Update behavior based on feedback (have feedback loop) |

---

## Gaps I Need to Close

1. **Verification step** - Not always verifying before marking done
2. **Multi-agent specialization** - Could have specific subagents for specific tasks
3. **Planning before execution** - Sometimes jump straight to doing
4. **Long-running task reliability** - Need better state management
5. **Learning from feedback** - Need to more actively update based on feedback

---

## Action Items

- [ ] Add verification step to all task completions
- [ ] Create specialized subagent templates (research, coding, outreach)
- [ ] Use NexusOS context more actively in sessions
- [ ] Track success/failure and learn from it
