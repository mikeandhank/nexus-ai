# Lipaira — The AI Agent Operating System

**Your AI. Your data. Your server.**

The enterprise-grade AI platform that runs entirely on your infrastructure. No cloud dependencies. No data leaving your premises. Just powerful AI agents that actually remember you.

## Why Lipaira?

### 🔒 Privacy-First Architecture
Your conversations, data, and AI agents live on your server. Not ours. Not OpenAI's. Not anywhere else. Perfect for enterprises with strict data compliance requirements.

### 🧠 Agents That Remember You
Our proprietary Inner Life system gives each agent persistent memory, personality, and context. They're not stateless chatbots—they build relationships over time.

### 🌐 Access Anywhere
Web-based interface accessible from any browser. Not CLI-bound like other developer tools. Team-friendly with role-based access.

### 🔌 integrations Ready
Pre-built connectors for Twilio (SMS/Voice), Stripe (payments), and more. Build automation workflows without coding.

### 💰 No Subscription Trap
Pay for compute once. No per-seat licensing. Self-hosted means you control costs.

## API-First Design

Everything you can do in the UI, you can do via API:

```bash
# Create an agent
curl -X POST /api/agents \
  -H "X-Nexus-Key: sk-xxx" \
  -d '{"name": "assistant", "personality": "helpful"}'

# Execute a task
curl -X POST /api/agents/agent-id/execute \
  -H "X-Nexus-Key: sk-xxx" \
  -d '{"task": "research market trends"}'
```
