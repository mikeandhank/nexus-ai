# NexusOS Model Registry

## Overview

NexusOS integrates with **OpenRouter** to provide access to 300+ AI models. We route requests based on user's quality preference, charge credits, and take a 5.5% fee.

|-----------|------|
| **Provider Cost** | What OpenRouter charges (per 1M tokens) |
| **Our Fee** | 5.5% of provider cost |

## Provider Routing

When user makes request:

```
User Request → Quality Setting → Model Selection → OpenRouter API → Response
                                           ↓
                                    Our Server
                                           ↓
                              Deduct credits (provider + 5.5%)
```

### Per-User Isolation
- Each user has their own API key
- Requests tagged with user ID
- Usage tracked per-user in `llm_usage` table

---

## Security

### API Keys
- **Stored:** Encrypted in PostgreSQL with pgcrypto
- **Usage:** Server-side only, never exposed to users
- **Rotation:** Can be rotated via admin endpoint

### Request Flow
1. User authenticates with their Nexus API key
2. Server looks up their quality preference
3. Server selects model based on quality tier
4. Server makes request to OpenRouter (using OUR key)
5. Response returned to user
6. Credits deducted from user's balance

**User never sees our OpenRouter key.**

## Rate Limits (Credit-Based)

| Credits | Requests/Min |
|---------|--------------|
| 100+ | 1,000 |
| 1,000+ | 2,500 |
| 10,000+ | 5,000 |
| 100,000+ | 10,000 |

## Adding New Models

Models are fetched dynamically from OpenRouter's API:

```bash
curl "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models"
```

No code changes needed - new models appear automatically.
